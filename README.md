Our website has a Home page which contains the landing screen as well as our project. When users click on the individual projects they will be redirected to a different page where they will be able to see more details about the projects. We also have an “About” page which gives users more information about our company.

# Landing Screen:

</p>

For our landing screen we used dark shades of blue as they represent elegance, authority, and intelligence. The blues we chose also combine very well with other colours. We also made use of a decorative pattern background as it works well with different screen sizes and keeps the user engaged and entertained.

To showcase our project, we used a simple image as the cover image and titled all our project. Users can click on each project to get more information about them. We used the squares to showcase the project as it gives a clean and clutter free design and the alignment creates an element of order on the website.

# Individual Project:

When users click on a project, they are redirected to a different page to get more information about the project. We included a turquoise colour to bring in a different colour element and keep things interesting. We kept the background simple to keep users focus on the project details. The images about the project are found above the text. We used one font to avoid the page looking too busy.

# About:

Our about page contains information about our company. We have a blue colour as well as a turquoise colour. This gives a sophisticated and refreshing look. The page is kept simple with to keep the users focus on the information. Some text elements are larger than others to create visual interest and not overwhelm users with information.
