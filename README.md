Our website has a Home page which contains the landing screen as well as our project. When users click on the individual projects they will be redirected to a different page where they will be able to see more details about the projects. We also have an “About” page which gives users more information about our company.

# Landing Screen:

Once the user scrolls down, they will encounter this section. This section provides a brief explanation on
what the website and the creators are about (us). This will provide an overview of the work we provide.
We do not want to distract the users from knowing the purpose of all this so we opted for a simple and
minimalistic design

# Profile Section

This section will showcase the various projects that we have completed. Once the user scrolls down,
he/she will reach this section after the about section. The user can surf through the various projects.
Upon hovering a specific project, a brief description of the project will pop up. If the user decides to click
on a project, the website will automatically scroll down to the project with a detailed explanation.
Rather than white another color can be used to enhance the feeling of the website in the profile section.
The last project the user accessed will be the first to show up in the image above
