# Design Proposal

Our website will be divided into 3 sections. These sections include the “Welcome” section, “Profile”
section and as well as the “About” section. Our website will be a single page application where you scroll
down to view more information

# Welcome Section

</p>

This is the general idea of how the welcome section will look. It will be at the very top of the page with
the title visible. Our theme for our website is mostly black (or dark colours) accompanied by white text.
Having a dark background highlights some of the features which have a lighter element to them This
includes text or images. It will have a picture on the left-hand side to give a general idea of what the
website is about

# About Section

<p align="center">

</p>

Once the user scrolls down, they will encounter this section. This section provides a brief explanation on
what the website and the creators are about (us). This will provide an overview of the work we provide.
We do not want to distract the users from knowing the purpose of all this so we opted for a simple and
minimalistic design

# Profile Section
